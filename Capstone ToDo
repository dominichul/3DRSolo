1. Complete/Decide on video analytics feature for drone - Nick, Dominic

2. Embed a maps (Google, Bing, whatever) application into a Java application. - Nick, Dominic
	a) Allow user to click on a location within the map and extract the Lon. Lat. coordinates from webapp, into Java application

3. Connect to Solo through ssh, within the Java application. - Szymon 
	a) ssh with user -> root@10.1.1.10
	b) password -> TjSDBkAu
	c) Move to folder with video analytic script (e.g., 'cd scripts/video)
	d) Execute analytic scripts with any needed arguments (e.g., 'python detectBodies.py -arg1 -arg2')
	e) Monitor print statements from python scripts and store needed data into JSON file (ex. print statement could return 'Body Count: 0' or 'Body Count: 1'. Parse each printed string for the 0 or 1 values)
	f) Close ssh connection when mission complete

4. Create a GUI for the user - Veronica, Brandon
	a) Setup page
		i) Embedded map application
		ii) Checkbox list with analytic features (only have one for now)
		iii) Launch/Start Mission Button (Exits current page and loads second page)
			1. This will execute multiple command line scripts
				a) mavproxy.py --master=udpin:0.0.0.0:14550 --out=udpout:127.0.0.1:14552 --out=udpout:127.0.0.1:14549 --out=udpout:127.0.0.1:14555
				b) tower udpin:127.0.0.1:14552
				c) python flightScript.py
				d) python vehicleStats.py
				e) python detectBodies.py (within ssh) 
	b) Control page
		i) GUI for displaying vehicle attributes fetched by the vehicleStats.py script. Loops/updates every 'x' interval
		ii) Embed the tower app to view real time drone location on Bing map (requires internet connection. If testing outdoors without connection, this will not work, unless using cell as a Wi-Fi hotspot)
		iii) Abort button (Acts as RTH (return to home))
		iv) Embed a VLC stream of what drone is seeing (right now, only able to do either analytics, or stream. Sponsor stated that a video stream isn't necessecary to have the stream viewable, however will still try to find a fix)

5. Have VTSCADA poll JSON file being written and updated by Java application on each 'x' interval.

6. Set a flag within VTSCADA when variable BodyCount > 0

*Still doesn't have to be body count. Could just use a bright colored object and try to detect that. It should be easier than body detection.
